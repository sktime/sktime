# The file specifies framework level core developers for automated review requests
#
# Note: historically, this file has been used to maintain a list of
# algorithm maintainers as specified in GOVERNANCE.md.
# This is no longer the case, algorithm maintainers are now
# specified directly in the estimator,
# in the "maintainers" tag of the respective scikit-base object.
#
# Algorithm maintainers are programmatically queriable
# via Estimator.get_class_tag("maintainers").
# Further lookup such as "which algorithms does M maintain"
# can be carried out using registry.all_estimators
