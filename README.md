# Welcome to sktime

> A unified interface for machine learning with time series

:rocket: **Version 0.23.1 out now!** [Check out the release notes here](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/changelog.html).

sktime is a library for time series analysis in Python. It provides a unified interface for multiple time series learning tasks. Currently, this includes time series classification, regression, clustering, annotation, and forecasting. It comes with [time series algorithms](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/estimator_overview.html) and [scikit-learn] compatible tools to build, tune and validate time series models.

[scikit-learn]: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

## :dizzy: Features
Our objective is to enhance the interoperability and usability of the time series analysis ecosystem in its entirety. sktime provides a __unified interface for distinct but related time series learning tasks__. It features [__dedicated time series algorithms__](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/estimator_overview.html) and __tools for composite model building__  such as pipelining, ensembling, tuning, and reduction, empowering users to apply an algorithm designed for one task to another.

sktime also provides **interfaces to related libraries**, for example [scikit-learn], [statsmodels], [tsfresh], [PyOD], and [fbprophet], among others.

For **deep learning**, see our companion package: [sktime-dl](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-dl).

## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Install sktime
For troubleshooting and detailed installation instructions, see the [documentation](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/installation.html).

- **Operating system**: macOS X · Linux · Windows 8.1 or higher
- **Python version**: Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 (only 64-bit)
- **Package managers**: [pip] · [conda] (via `conda-forge`)

[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
[conda]: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/

### pip
Using pip, sktime releases are available as source packages and binary wheels.
Available wheels are listed [here](https://pypi.org/simple/sktime/).

```bash
pip install sktime
```

or, with maximum dependencies,

```bash
pip install sktime[all_extras]
```

For curated sets of soft dependencies for specific learning tasks:

```bash
pip install sktime[forecasting]  # for selected forecasting dependencies
pip install sktime[forecasting,transformations]  # forecasters and transformers
```

or similar. Valid sets are:

* `forecasting`
* `transformations`
* `classification`
* `regression`
* `clustering`
* `param_est`
* `networks`
* `annotation`
* `alignment`

Cave: in general, not all soft dependencies for a learning task are installed,
only a curated selection.

### conda
You can also install sktime from `conda` via the `conda-forge` channel.
The feedstock including the build recipe and configuration is maintained
in [this conda-forge repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/sktime-feedstock).

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge sktime
```

or, with maximum dependencies,

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge sktime-all-extras
```

(as `conda` does not support dependency sets,
flexible choice of soft dependencies is unavailable via `conda`)

## :zap: Quickstart

### Forecasting

``` python
from sktime.datasets import load_airline
from sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon
from sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split
from sktime.forecasting.theta import ThetaForecaster
from sktime.performance_metrics.forecasting import mean_absolute_percentage_error

y = load_airline()
y_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)
fh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)
forecaster = ThetaForecaster(sp=12)  # monthly seasonal periodicity
forecaster.fit(y_train)
y_pred = forecaster.predict(fh)
mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)
>>> 0.08661467738190656
```

### Time Series Classification

```python
from sktime.classification.interval_based import TimeSeriesForestClassifier
from sktime.datasets import load_arrow_head
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X, y = load_arrow_head()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
classifier = TimeSeriesForestClassifier()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
>>> 0.8679245283018868
```
