# Even if empty this file is useful so that when running from the root folder
# the local codebase is added to sys.path by pytest. See
# https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/pythonpath.html for more details.  For
# example, this allows us to build extensions in place and run pytest using the package
# from the local folder rather than the one from site-packages.
