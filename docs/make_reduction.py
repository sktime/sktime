def make_reduction(exogenous_data: np.ndarray, transformers: List[Transformer]) -> Reduction:
    """
    Create a reduction object by combining exogenous data and transformers.

    This function takes the exogenous data, which represents external variables or features that may
    impact the forecasted values, and a list of transformers that preprocess or transform the exogenous
    data. It combines these components to create a reduction object that can be used for forecasting.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    exogenous_data : np.ndarray
        The exogenous data is an array-like object containing additional information or features
        that can be used to enhance the accuracy of the forecast. It should be a NumPy array-like
        object, where each row represents a timestamp and each column represents a specific feature
        or variable.

    transformers : List[Transformer]
        Transformers are objects that preprocess or transform the exogenous data before it is used
        in the forecasting process. They should be provided as a list of transformer objects. Each
        transformer is applied sequentially in the order they appear in the list. The output of one
        transformer serves as the input to the next transformer.

    Returns:
    --------
    reduction : Reduction
        A reduction object that encapsulates the exogenous data and transformers, allowing them to
        be used in the forecasting process.

    Examples:
    ---------
    >>> exogenous_data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> transformers = [StandardScaler(), PCA(n_components=2)]
    >>> reduction = make_reduction(exogenous_data, transformers)
    >>> forecast = reduction.forecast()

    In this example, the exogenous data is a 3x3 NumPy array representing three timestamps with
    three features. Two transformers, StandardScaler and PCA with 2 components, are applied to the
    exogenous data to preprocess and transform it. The resulting reduction object can then be used
    to generate forecasts.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The exogenous data should be preprocessed and transformed appropriately to ensure compatibility
      with the forecasting models used later.
    - The transformers can perform operations such as scaling, normalization, dimensionality reduction,
      or any other relevant transformation that is necessary for the specific forecasting task.
    - The transformers are applied sequentially in the order they appear in the list. Ensure that the
      order of transformers is appropriate for the desired preprocessing steps.
    - The reduction object returned by this function can be used with various forecasting models
      that accept reduction objects as input.
