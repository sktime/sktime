Mission statement
-----------------

sktime enables understandable and composable machine learning with time
series. It provides `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_
compatible algorithms and model composition tools, supported by a clear
taxonomy of learning tasks, with instructive documentation and a friendly community.


History
-------

sktime was started in April 2019 as a collaborative project between
Franz Király, Markus Löning, Tony Bagnall and Jason
Lines. In the first year, it grew into a community-driven project with
contributions from researchers and practitioners from around the globe.

Sprints
-------

The `2019 joint sktime MLJ development sprint <https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/tree/master/previous_workshops/2019_sktime_MLJ_joint_dev_sprint>`_ was kindly hosted by `UCL
<https://www.ucl.ac.uk>`_ and `The Alan Turing Institute <https://turing.ac
.uk>`_. Some participants could attend thanks to the
initial funding of the `The Alan Turing Institute <https://turing.ac.uk>`_.


Infrastructure support
----------------------

We would also like to thank `Microsoft Azure <https://azure.microsoft
.com/en-gb/services/devops/>`_, `Travis Cl <https://travis-ci.org/>`_,
and `AppVeyor <https://www.appveyor.com>`_ for the free computing time on their
Continuous Integration servers.
