# Funding

sktime is a community-driven project, however institutional and private grants help to assure its sustainability.

We would like to thank the following supporters.

## Research grants

[The Alan Turing Institute] funded three months of the initial development under the UKRI Strategic
Priorities Fund (EPSRC grant no EP/T001569/1), particularly the [Tools,
Practices and Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/tools-practices-and-systems-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-scoping-workshop) theme within that grant.

Markus LoÌˆning's contribution was supported by the [UK Economic and Social
Research Council (ESRC)](https://esrc.ukri.org), the [Consumer Data
Research Centre (CDRC)](https://www.cdrc.ac.uk), and the Enrichment
Scheme at the [The Alan Turing Institute].

## Institutional sponsorship

The [2019 joint sktime MLJ development sprint](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-workshops/tree/master/previous_workshops/2019_sktime_MLJ_joint_dev_sprint) was kindly hosted by [UCL] and [The Alan Turing Institute]. Some participants could attend thanks to the
initial funding of the [The Alan Turing Institute].

## Infrastructure support

We would also like to thank [Microsoft Azure], [GitHub Actions], [AppVeyor] and [ReadtheDocs] for the free compute time on their servers.
