# History

sktime was started in April 2019 as a collaborative project between Franz Király, Markus Löning, Anthony Bagnall and Jason Lines.
In the first year, it grew into a community-driven project with contributions from researchers and practitioners from around the globe.

Today, sktime continues to undergo rapid development to refine its API, while adding new features and algorithms for a range of time series machine learning tasks.
Development is supported by the original project members, new core developers and the broader community (see [contributors]).
