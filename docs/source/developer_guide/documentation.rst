Documentation
=============

Providing instructive documentation is a key part of ``sktime's`` mission. In order to meet this,
developers are expected to follow ``sktime's`` documentation standards.

These include:

* Documenting code using NumPy docstrings
* Following ``sktime's`` docstring convention for public code artifacts and modules
* Adding new public functionality to the :ref:`api_refernce` and :ref:`user guide <user_guide>`

More detailed information on ``sktime's`` documentation format is provided below.
