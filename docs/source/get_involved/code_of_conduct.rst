Code of Conduct
===============

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to
ensure an that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling
experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the sktime project
is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at
all times.

Dr Franz Király, as principal investigator of this project, and all
project members, are dedicated to a **harassment-free experience for
everyone**, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
age or religion. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of
our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious
collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills,
and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to
conform to the following Code of Conduct.

1 Introduction
--------------

sktime is a community-oriented and -led project. We value the
involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a
friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing.
All participants in our in-person events and online communications are
expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in activities
associated with the sktime project is required to conform to this Code
of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the
sktime project including, but not limited to, in-person focus groups and
workshops, and communications online via GitHub.

The lead investigator of the sktime - Dr Franz Király - is responsible
for enforcing the Code of Conduct. He can be contacted by emailing
f.kiraly@ucl.ac.uk.

Reports may be reviewed by other members of the core development team,
unless there is a conflict of interest, and will be kept confidential.

2 Code of Conduct
-----------------

The sktime team are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As
such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our
community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to
others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on
characteristics that include, but are not limited to: gender identity
and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy,
familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief
(or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age,
education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience
level.

Everyone who participates in the sktime project activities is required
to conform to this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all
spaces managed by the sktime project including, but not limited to, in
person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub.
By participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the
procedures by which the sktime project core development team resolves
any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing
of their personal information.

2.1 Expected Behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are confident that our community members will together build a
supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online
communications. The following bullet points set out explicitly what we
hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:

-  **Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences**. Do not
   engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist,
   or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.
-  **Use welcoming and inclusive language**. Exclusionary comments or
   jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address
   others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate
   of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and
   respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!)
   language for some participants.
-  **Do not harass people**. Harassment includes unwanted physical
   contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that
   consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are
   unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask
   them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.
-  **Respect the privacy and safety of others**. Do not take photographs
   of others without their permission. Do not share other participant’s
   personal experiences without their express permission. Note that
   posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information
   of others without their consent ("doxing") is a form of harassment.
-  **Be considerate of others’ participation**. Everyone should have an
   opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments
   succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do
   not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments
   until they have finished speaking.
-  **Don’t be a bystander**. If you see something inappropriate
   happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but
   feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of
   Conduct response team for support.
-  As an overriding general rule, please **be intentional in your
   actions and humble in your mistakes**.

All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either
online or in-person. See `this explanation of the four social
rules <https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules>`__ - no
feigning surprise, no well-actually's, no back-seat driving, no subtle
-isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.

2.2 Unacceptable Behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by sktime community members at any
project event or platform include:

-  written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
   on the basis of membership of any specific group
-  causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
   following, or intimidation
-  violent threats or language directed against another person
-  the display of sexual or violent images
-  unwelcome sexual attention
-  nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
-  sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
-  insults or put downs
-  sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary
   jokes
-  excessive swearing
-  incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
-  continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or
   recording) with someone after being asked to stop
-  publication of private communication without consent

2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are
expected to comply immediately. This applies to all sktime community
events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant
engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of
the core development team may warn the offender, ask them to leave the
event or platform (without refund), or impose any other appropriate
sanctions (see the `enforcement manual <#enforcement-manual>`__ for
details).

2.4 Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Code of Conduct is not intended as a static set of rules by which
everyone must abide. Rather, you are invited to make suggestions for
updates or clarifications by contacting Dr Franz Király at
f.kiraly@ucl.ac.uk or by making a pull request to this document on
GitHub.

3 Incident Reporting Guidelines
-------------------------------

3.1 Contact points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please contact the current chair of the code of conduct committee directly by email, see 4.1.

3.2 Alternate contact points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of conflict of interest of sktime CoC committee members, you can report
through the [NumFOCUS CoC process](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct),
or, in case of events, to the organisation at which the event is taking place (e.g., a university).

3.3 What to do if urgent action is needed, e.g., physical danger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you believe someone is in physical danger, please contact the
appropriate emergency responders asap.

If you believe urgent action is necessary,
proceed as per Section 4.3 - Acting Unilaterally.

3.4 Code of Conduct Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We believe it is important to have an actionable plan before something
happens. We therefore have a detailed enforcement policy which is
available in the Enforcement Manual below.

4 Enforcement Manual
--------------------

This is the enforcement manual followed by the sktime project research
team. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're
consistent and fair. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct should be
respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.

4.1 The Code of Conduct Committee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sktime Code of Conduct committee currently consists of:

Dr Franz Király (f.kiraly@ucl.ac.uk)

We encourage community members to step up to become a member of the committee.

You can use the NumFOCUS CoC reporting process as an alternative entry point
for reporting, see 3.2.

4.2 Code of Conduct Investigation Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CoC investigation process involves the following steps:

1. **Urgent action.** Upon obtaining knowledge of an incident, receiving a report,
or an allegation of misconduct (either called "report" in the below),
the Code of Conduct committee will make an initial assessment on whether the situation is urgent.
The Code of Conduct committee will assess:

-  whether this is an ongoing situation and likely timelines are urgent
-  whether there is a threat to anyone's safety or health
-  what happened
-  whether this event likely constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
-  who, if anyone, was the bad actor

If it seems likely that swift action is needed to prevent or mitigate harm,
the process proceeds as in Section 4.3, Urgent Situations.
"Swift action" means, action on a time scale shorter than the >10 days in the process below. 

2. **Initial investigation.** If the situation is not deemed urgent, the Code of Conduct committee
proceeds with an initial investigation of the situation, collecting information in person or in writing.
This should include asking any reporters or complainants (persons making allegations of misconduct)
for relevant evidence. Complainants, if applicable, should be asked for evidence backing allegations.

The investigation may also include requesting information from potential witnesses and potential bad actors.
Identifying information of reporters, complainants, potential witnesses or bad actors should not be shared in the process.

At this stage, no one should assumed to be a bad actor, and suspicions should not be communicated.

3. **Initial investigation report.** The Code of Conduct committee will produce a written summary of the
information surrounding the report and initial investigation for its own use.

4. **Decision: formal suspicion.** The Code of Conduct committee will decide whether the evidence and information
in the summary report justifies formal suspicion of any individuals having been bad actors.
If not, the process moves on to part 9 - decision on the outcome.

5. **Preliminary hearing.** If suspicion is upheld, the Code of Conduct committee will inform supsected
bad actors of the precise nature of the formal suspicion, with a reasonable timeline given
to suspected bad actors to respond in writing. This includes the opportunity to summarize
a defense to the Code of Conduct committee, including potential counter-evidence
or extenuating conditions.

6. **Decision: probable cause.** The Code of Conduct committee will decide whether the sum of initial investigation findings
and the responses by suspected bad actor justify probable cause, for each suspected bad actor.
If yes, the process proceeds to formal investigation.
If not, the suspicion of being a bad actor is formally dropped,
and the process moves on to part 9 - decision on the outcome.

7. **Formal investigation**. If probable cause is found, the Code of Conduct committee proceeds
proceeds with the formal investigation. Besides the means available in an initial investigation,
the Code of Conduct committee may make requests to potential witnesses and suspected bad actors
to provide information.

8. **Formal investigation report.** The Code of Conduct committee will produce a written summary of the
information surrounding the formal investigation for its own use.

9. **Decision: outcome**. The Code of Conduct committee will seek to agree on a resolution by
consensus of all members investigating the report in question.
If the committee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over 5 working days excluding week-ends,
the currently longest serving committee member will break ties.

10. **Outcome reporting.** any reporters, complainants, and bad actors are
informed of the outcome, in writing. The Code of Conduct committee will produce a
written case summary of the for its own use.

11. **Enforcement.** As the main ``sktime`` executive body, the ``sktime``
community council ensures that resolutions are enforced.

12. **Appeals.** Appeals can be directed to the ``sktime`` Code of Conduct committee,
or the NumFOCUS code of conduct process.
The ``sktime`` Code of Conduct committee accepts appeals resolutions
arising from the NumFOCUS code of conduct process to supersede ``sktime`` resolutions.

Timelines:

* In case of reported CoC violations, the Code of Conduct committee
will aim to have a resolution agreed upon
within 10 working days, excluding week-ends.
In the event that a resolution cannot be determined in
that time, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will respond to the
reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.
* individuals under suspicion of being bad actors should be given 10 working days,
excluding week-ends, to respond in their own defense, in the preliminary hearing phase.

Special considerations:

* Where possible, identities of reporters, complainants, bad actors, witnesses, should
  be kept anonymous.
* if an urgent situation arises in the process of investigation, e.g.,
  reprisals by a bad actor or other ramifications, action should be taken as in
  Section 4.3, Acting Unilaterally.
* In reports, all participants will be anonymised, i.e.,
  referred to as "Community Member 1",
  "Community Member 2", or "Research Team Member 1". The "de-anonymising
  key" will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated
  reports against the same person over time.
* the standard of proof is "on the balance of probabilities"
* new information on issues not under investigation brought to light by the initial
  or formal investigation is to be treated as a new report or incident
* absence of response in a given timeline counts as a response

4.3 Urgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to
anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any member of the community
may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect the safety of any
community member. This can include contacting law enforcement (or other
local personnel), or speaking on behalf of the ``sktime`` team,
without prior community consensus.

If the act is ongoing, any community member may act immediately, before
reaching consensus, to diffuse the situation. In ongoing situations, any
member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available in this
enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online, or removal from a
physical space.

In situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally,
they must inform the sktime community council via info@sktime.org
as soon as possible, and report their actions for review within 24 hours.

4.4 Resolutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Possible responses may include:

-  A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community
   members.
-  A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a
   community member.
-  A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the
   Code of Conduct.
-  Nothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the
   scope of this Code of Conduct.
-  A private in-person conversation between a member of the research
   team and the individual(s) involved. In this case, the person who has
   the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.
-  A private written reprimand from a member of the research team to the
   individual(s) involved. In this case, the research team member will
   deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing Dr
   Franz Király for record keeping.
-  A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that
   the violation occurred (i.e. on the listserv for a listserv
   violation; GitHub for a GitHub violation, etc.). The committee may
   choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
-  An imposed "time out" from online spaces. Dr Franz Király will
   communicate this "time out" to the individual(s) involved.
-  A permanent or temporary ban from some or all sktime project spaces
   (GitHub, in-person events etc). The research team will maintain
   records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future,
   extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or
   otherwise maintained. If a member of the community is removed from an
   event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they
   miss.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of
the Code of Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any
other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The Code of
Conduct committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and
must note feedback for the record. However, the Code of Conduct
committee is not required to act on this feedback.

4.5 Conflicts of Interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of conflict of interest of sktime CoC committee members, you can report
through the [NumFOCUS CoC process](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct),
or, in case of events, to the organisation at which the event is taking place (e.g., a university).
