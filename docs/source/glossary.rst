    Scitype
        See :term:`scientific type`.

    Scientific type
        A class or object type to denote a category of objects defined by a
        common interface and data scientific purpose. For example, "forecaster"
        or "classifier".

    Forecasting
        A learning task focused on prediction future values of a time series. For more details, see the :ref:`user_guide_forecasting`.

    Time series
         Data where the :term:`variable` measurements are ordered over time or an index indicating the position of an observation in the sequence of values.

    Time series classification
        A learning task focused on using the patterns across instances between the time series and a categorical target variable.

    Time series regression
        A learning task focused on using the patterns across instances between the time series and a continuous target variable.

    Time series clustering
        A learning task focused on discovering groups consisting of instances with similar time series.

    Time series annotation
        A learning task focused on labeling the timepoints of a time series. This includes the related tasks of outlier detection, anomaly detection, change point detection and segmentation.

    Panel time series
        A form of time series data where the same time series are observed observed for multiple observational units. The observed series may consist of :term:`univariate time series` or
        :term:`multivariate time series`. Accordingly, the data varies across time, observational unit and series (i.e. variables).

    Univariate time series
        A single time series. While univariate analysis often only uses information contained in the series itself,
        univariate time series regression and forecasting can also include :term:`exogenous` data.

    Multivariate time series
        Multiple time series. Typically observed for the same observational unit. Multivariate time series
        is typically used to refer to cases where the series evolve together over time. This is related, but different than the cases where
        a :term:`univariate time series` is dependent on :term:`exogenous` data.

    Endogenous
        Within a learning task endogenous variables are determined by exogenous variables or past timepoints of the variable itself. Also referred to
        as the dependent variable or target.

    Exogenous
        Within a learning task exogenous variables are external factors whose pattern of impact on tasks' endogenous variables must be learned.
        Also referred to as independent variables or features.

    Reduction
        Reduction refers to decomposing a given learning task into simpler tasks that can be composed to create a solution to the original task.
        In ``sktime`` reduction is used to allow one learning task to be adapted as a solution for an alternative task.

    Variable
        Refers to some measurement of interest. Variables may be cross-sectional (e.g. time-invariant measurements like a patient's place of birth) or
        :term:`time series`.

    Timepoint
        The point in time that an observation is made. A time point may represent an exact point in time (a timestamp),
        a timeperiod (e.g. minutes, hours or days), or simply an index indicating the position of an observation in the sequence of values.

    Instance
        A member of the set of entities being studied and which an ML practitioner wishes to generalize. For example,
        patients, chemical process runs, machines, countries, etc. May also be referred to as samples, examples, observations or records
        depending on the discipline and context.

    Trend
        When data shows a long-term increase or decrease, this is referred to as a trend. Trends can also be non-linear.

    Seasonality
        When a :term: `time series` is affected by seasonal characteristics such as the time of year or the day of the week, it is called a seasonal pattern.
        The duration of a season is always fixed and known.

    Tabular
        Is a setting where each :term:`timepoint` of the :term:`univariate time series` being measured for each instance are treated as features and
        stored as a primitive data type in the DataFrameâ€™s cells. E.g., there are N :term:`instances <instance>` of time series and each has T
        :term:`timepoints <timepoint>`, this would yield a pandas DataFrame with shape (N, T): N rows, T columns.
