Welcome to sktime
=================

  A unified framework for machine learning with time series.


Mission
=======

.. include:: about/_mission.rst


Scope
=====

sktime features a unified interface for multiple time series learning tasks.
Currently, we support :ref:`forecasting <forecasting_ref>`, :ref:`time series classification <classification_ref>`, :ref:`time series regression <regression_ref>` and :ref:`time series clustering <clustering_ref>`.
We have experimental support for time series annotation.

Features:

* API for machine learning with time series, for the purpose of specifying, fitting, applying and validating machine learning models
* Interactive user experience with scikit-learn like syntax conventions

Technical specification:

* In-memory computation of a single machine, no distributed computing
* Medium-sized data in pandas and NumPy
* Modular, principled and object-oriented API
* Making use of interactive Python interpreter, no command-line interface or graphical user interface
