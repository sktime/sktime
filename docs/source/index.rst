  A unified framework for machine learning with time series


sktime Fall dev days
====================

Please join the sktime community Nov 9 - 10 2022 for our virtual Fall dev days.  There will be an additional in-person social
option in regions with enough participants. Our core hours will be 10-12 UTC, with additional meeting before/after these core hours!
This is a great opportunity for new community members to learn more about how to contribute to sktime as well as a good opportunity
for existing members to share what we have been up to! Please register
`here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQkrSZfNiZiQKPuBcFMtHAlL10RBZ3QSBo-I3klUHeL7Vg0A/viewform>`_!

Mission
=======

.. include:: about/_mission.rst

Scope
=====

sktime features a unified interface for multiple time series learning tasks.
Currently, we support :ref:`forecasting <forecasting_ref>`, :ref:`time series classification <classification_ref>`, :ref:`time series regression <regression_ref>` and :ref:`time series clustering <clustering_ref>`.
We have experimental support for time series annotation.

Features:

* API for machine learning with time series, for the purpose of specifying, fitting, applying and validating machine learning models
* Interactive user experience with scikit-learn like syntax conventions

Technical specification:

* In-memory computation of a single machine, no distributed computing
* Medium-sized data in pandas and NumPy
* Modular, principled and object-oriented API
* Making use of interactive Python interpreter, no command-line interface or graphical user interface
