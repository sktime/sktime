Documenation
============

* Do they follow the NumPy format and sktime conventions?
* If the same parameter, attribute, return object or error is included elsewhere in sktime are the docstring descriptions
  as similar as possible
* Does the online documentation render correctly with the changes?
* Do the docstrings contain links to the relevant topics in the :ref:`glossary` or :ref:`user_guide`?

.. warning::

    If a Pull Request does not meet sktime's :ref:`documentation guide <developer_guide_documentation>`
    a reviewer should require the documentation be updated prior to approving the Pull Request.
