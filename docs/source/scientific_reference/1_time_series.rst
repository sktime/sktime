Scientific reference: time series
=================================

``sktime``'s conceptual model is based on a number of "time series" related mathematical
objects:

* "time series", observations of a single process made over time.
Example: average temperature in London, on a given day.
* "time series panels", collections of multiple time series, independently observed.
Example: fever curves of 10 specific hospital patients, for the time in the hospital.
* "hierarchical time series", collections of multiple time series where individual
instances are observed at instances defined by variables defining the hierarchy.
Example: gummy bear sales at 100 specific stores, in 10 federal states.

This document provides a formal reference for the above.
The objects are defined in terms of:

* abstract data types (ADT) - defines domain, type and common operations
* scientific types (scitype) - ADT plus statistical assumptions


Primitive values - the `Primitives` scitype
-------------------------------------------

The following sets/domains are called basic primitive domains:

* the real numbers, i.e., the set :math:`\mathbb{R}`
* the set of boolean truth value, i.e., the two-element set containing `True` or `False`
* the set of all finite length strings of ASCII characters
* any other finite set :math:`\mathcal{C}`, called "category set" in this context

A set/domain is called primitive domain if it is a basic primitive domain, or
finite Cartesian products of basic primitive domains.

An object is said to be of primitive type if it is an element of a primitive domain.

We use the scitype `Primitives` to type objects of primitive type.


Time Series - the `Series` scitype
----------------------------------

An indexed series, with value domain :math:`\mathcal{X}`, index domain :math:`\mathcal{T}`,
of length :math:`T`, is a collection of index points :math:`t_1, \dots, t_T` and observations
:math:`x_1, \dots x_T`. We say (and interpret) that :math:`x_i` is the value observed at index
:math:`t_i`.

For an indexed series :math:`s`, with value domain :math:`\mathcal{X}`, index domain :math:`\mathcal{T}`,
with time points :math:`x_1, \dots x_T` and index points :math:`t_1, \dots, t_T`, we:

* write :math:`\ell(s) := T`, and call `\ell(s)` the "length of :math:`s`"
* write :math:`\mbox{values}(s) := (x_1, \dots, x_T)`, and call :math:`\mbox{values}(s)` the "value sequence of:math:`s`"
* write :math:`\mbox{index}(s) := (t_1, \dots, t_T)`, and call :math:`\mbox{values}(s)` the "index sequence of:math:`s`"
* write :math:`\tau \in \mbox{index}(s)` if :math:`\tau = t_i` for some :math:`i`
* write :math:`s(\tau) := x_i` if :math:`\tau = t_i` and if
there is a unique :math:`i` such that :math:`\tau = t_i`
* call :math:`s(\tau)` the "value of :math:`s` at index :math:`\tau`"
* may choose to say that :math:`s` is a time series if :math:`\mathcal{T}`
is totally ordered and (order)-isomorphic to a sub-set of :math:`\mathbb{R}`,
in a context where elements of :math:`\mathcal{T}` are interpreted as time stamps
* write :math:`\mbox{series}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{T})` for the set of all index series
with value domain :math:`\mathcal{X}`, index domain :math:`\mathcal{T}`

Key operations for the above indexed series :math:`s` are:

* inspecting :math:`\ell(s)`
* inspecting :math:`\mbox{index}(s)` or :math:`\mbox{values}(s)`
* for a :math:`\tau \in \mbox{index}(s)`, retrieve :math:`s(\tau)`
* inspect the value domain :math:`\mathcal{X}` or index domain :math:`\mathcal{T}` of :math:`s`
* sub-setting and selection operations

For an indexed series :math:`s\in \mbox{series}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{T})`, we say that
:math:`s` is:

* univariate, if :math:`\mathcal{X}` is a basic primitive domain
* multivariate, if :math:`\mathcal{X}` is a primitive domain but not a basic primitive domain
* of primitive value domain, if :math:`\mathcal{X}` is a primitive domain; otherwise, of non-primitive value domain
* degenerate, if :math:`\ell(s)=0` or :math:`\mathcal{X}` has one or less elements

For a time series :math:`s\in \mbox{series}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{T})`, we say that
:math:`s` is:

* equally spaced, if :math:`t_{i+1} - t_i = c` for some :math:`c\in\mathbb{R}` and all
    :math:`i\in 1,\dots, T-1`
* unequally spaced, if :math:`s` is not equally spaced.

We use the scitype `Series` to type univariate and multivariate time series.

For `Series` typed,
:math:`\mbox{series}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{T})`-valued random variables,
we make no additional assumptions about the law (e.g., stationarity).


Notes on the `Series` scitype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``sktime`` conceptual model differs in some points from
occasionally found conceptualization approaches in mathematical textbooks:

* defining time series only over a finite index set :math:`t_1,\dots, t_T`,
instead of, say, defining :math:`s(t)` for all :math:`t` in an infinite or even
uncountably infinite set (e.g., the reals). This is because, in a computer,
time series observations are always finite.
Some books do not make this distinction and conflate "generative" knowledge
in mathematical assumptions with observed information.
We made this decisions since real observations, including those that ``python`` can handle, are always finite.
* considering the index set as part of the time series and crucial, inspectable information.
Some sources conceptualize the index set as "external" to the time series, or irrelevant.
We think that considering the index set as part of the time series is conceptually natural for any user of ``pandas``.
* allowing the value domain to range over primitives, not over :math:`\mathbb{R}` or a subset thereof.
Again, having "data frame row" typed observations, and not just float arrays, is conceptually natural for any user of ``pandas``.


Time Series panels - the `Panel` scitype
----------------------------------------

A panel of indexed series, with index domain :math:`\mathcal{T}`, is an ordered collection
of indexed series :math:`s_1, \dots, s_N`,
all having the same index domain :math:`\mathcal{T}`,
and :math:`s_i` having value domain :math:`\mathcal{X}_i`,
potentially differring between individual indexed series.

For a panel of indexed series :math:`p`, consisting of
indexed series :math:`s_1, \dots, s_N`, we:

* write :math:`\ell(p) := N`, and call `\ell(p)` the "number of instances in :math:`p`"
* write :math:`p_i := s_i`, and call :math:`p_i` the ":math:`i`-th instance of :math:`p`"
* call :math:`p_i` a "series in the panel :math:`p`"
* write :math:`\mbox{panel}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{T})` for the set of all panels
whose series all have (the same) value domain :math:`\mathcal{X}`, and index domain :math:`\mathcal{T}`

Key operations for the above indexed series :math:`p` are:

* inspecting :math:`\ell(p)`
* inspecting :math:`p_i`
* sub-setting and selection operations for series, applied to all series in the panel

For a panel of indexed series :math:`p`, with index domain :math:`\mathcal{T}`, we say that
:math:`p` is:

* a panel of time series, if all series in the panel :math:`p` are time series
* of homogeneous value domain if all series in the panel :math:`p`
have the same value domain; that is, if :math:`p_i\in \mbox{panel}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{T})`
for some :math:`\mathcal{X}` and all :math:`i = 1, \dots, N`.
* uni-/multivariate, if :math:`p` is of homogeneous value domain and all series in the
panel :math:`p` are uni-/multivariate
* of primitive value domain, if all series in the panel :math:`p` are of primitive domain; otherwise, of non-primitive value domain
* of equal length, if all series in the panel :math:`p` have equal length;
that is, there is :math:`L` such that :math:`\ell(p_i) = L` for all :math:`i = 1, \dots, N`.
* (un-)equally spaced, all series in the panel :math:`p` are (un)-equally spaced
* grid-like, if :math:`p` is of equal length, and equally spaced
* of equal index, if all series in the panel :math:`p` have the same index sequence;
that is, there is :math:`L` and :math:`I\in \mathcal{T}^L`
such that :math:`\mbox{index}(p_i) = I` for all :math:`i = 1, \dots, N`.
* degenerate, if :math:`N=0` or at least one of the series in the panel :math:`p` is degenerate

We use the scitype `Panel` to type panels of time series, of primitive value domain.

For `Panel` typed random variables, a typical assumption is that the time series
in the panel are i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed). This assumption
extends to length, value domain, and index set.

If the i.i.d. assumption is not made, we explicitly refer to "non-i.i.d. `Panel`" objects.
