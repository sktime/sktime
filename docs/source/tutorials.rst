Tutorials
=========

Below are introductory tutorials for ``sktime``.

Each tutorial is located in its own repository, which contains notebooks and links to a youtube video walkthrough.

.. note::

    The tutorials and videos are based on snapshots of ``sktime`` at earlier versions.
    They explain stable functionality which rarely changes, and most of the content is continuously tested in ``sktime`` CI.
    Nonetheless, there may be outdated parts - in such a case, we would be very thankful for bug reports.

For user guides specific to learning tasks, see our :ref:`user_guide` page.
The user guide notebooks are always functional with the most recent stable version.
