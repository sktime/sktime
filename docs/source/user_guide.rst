User Guide
==========

Welcome to sktime's user guide!

The user guide consists of introductory notebooks, ordered by learning task.

For guided tutorials with videos, see our :ref:`tutorials` page.

To run the user guide notebooks interactively, you can
`launch them on binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sktime/sktime/main?filepath=examples>`_
without having to install anything.

We assume basic familiarity with `scikit-learn`_. If you haven't worked with scikit-learn before, check out their
`getting-started guide`_.

The notebook files can be found `here <https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/examples>`_.
