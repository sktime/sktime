    "### 1.3 basic evaluation workflow - evaluating a batch of forecasts against ground truth observations\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to evaluate statistical performance of a forecaster before deploying it, and regularly re-evaluate performance if in continuous deployment. The evaluation workflow for the basic batch forecasting task, as solved by the workflow in Section 1.2, consists of comparing batch forecasts with actuals. This is sometimes called (batch-wise) backtesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic evaluation workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. splitting a representatively chosen historical series into a temporal training and test set. The test set should be temporally in the future of the training set.\n",
    "2. obtaining batch forecasts, as in Section 1.2, by fitting a forecaster to the training set, and querying predictions for the test set\n",
    "3. specifying a quantitative performance metric to compare the actual test set against predictions\n",
    "4. computing the quantitative performance on the test set\n",
    "5. testing whether this performance is statistically better than a chosen baseline performance\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: step 5 (testing) is currently not supported in `sktime`, but is on the development roadmap. For the time being, it is advised to use custom implementations of appropriate methods (e.g., Diebold-Mariano test; stationary confidence intervals).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: note that this evaluation set-up determines how well a given algorithm would have performed on past data. Results are only insofar representative as future performance can be assumed to mirror past performance. This can be argued under certain assumptions (e.g., stationarity), but will in general be false. Monitoring of forecasting performance is hence advised in case an algorithm is applied multiple times."

    "**Example:** In the example, we will us the same airline data as in Section 1.2.

This is then considered as an indication of how well the forecaster would perform in the coming 3 years (what was done in Section 1.2). This may or may not be a stretch depending on statistical assumptions and data properties (caution: it often is a stretch - past performance is in general not indicative of future performance)."

    "## 4. Extension guide - implementing your own forecaster\n",
    "\n",
    "`sktime` is meant to be easily extensible, for direct contribution to `sktime` as well as for local/private extension with custom methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend `sktime` with a new local or contributed forecaster, a good workflow to follow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. read through the [forecasting extension template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/forecasting.py) - this is a `python` file with `todo` blocks that mark the places in which changes need to be added.\n",
    "2. optionally, if you are planning any major surgeries to the interface: look at the [base class architecture](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/base/_base.py) - note that \"ordinary\" extension (e.g., new algorithm) should be easily doable without this.\n",
    "3. copy the forecasting extension template to a local folder in your own repository (local/private extension), or to a suitable location in your clone of the `sktime` or affiliated repository (if contributed extension), inside `sktime.forecasting`; rename the file and update the file docstring appropriately.\n",
    "4. address the \"todo\" parts. Usually, this means: changing the name of the class, setting the tag values, specifying hyper-parameters, filling in `__init__`, `_fit`, `_predict`, and optional methods such as `_update` (for details see the extension template). You can add private methods as long as they do not override the default public interface. For more details, see the extension template.\n",
    "5. to test your estimator manually: import your estimator and run it in the worfklows in Section 1; then use it in the compositors in Section 3.\n",
    "6. to test your estimator automatically: call `sktime.tests.test_all_estimators.test_estimator` on your estimator - note that the function takes the class, not an object instance. Before the call, you need to register the new estimator in `sktime.tests._config`, as an import, and by adding default parameter settings to the `ESTIMATOR_TEST_PARAMS` variable (the `dict` entry `key` is the class, and entry is a `scikit-learn` parameter set). `pytest` will also add the call to its automated tests in a working clone of the `sktime` repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of direct contribution to `sktime` or one of its affiliated packages, additionally:\n",
    "* add yourself as an author to the code, and to the `CODEOWNERS` for the new estimator file(s).\n",
    "* create a pull request that contains only the new estimators (and their inheritance tree, if it's not just one class), as well as the automated tests as described above.\n",
    "* in the pull request, describe the estimator and optimally provide a publication or other technical reference for the strategy it implements.\n",
    "* before making the pull request, ensure that you have all necessary permissions to contribute the code to a permissive license (BSD-3) open source project."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sktime` comes with several forecasting algorithms (or forecasters), all of which share a common interface. The interface is fully interoperable with the `scikit-learn` interface, and provides dedicated interface points for forecasting in batch and rolling mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sktime` comes with rich composition functionality that allows to build complex pipelines easily, and connect easily with other parts of the open source ecosystem, such as `scikit-learn` and individual algorithm libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sktime` is easy to extend, and comes with user friendly tools to facilitate implementing and testing your own forecasters and composition principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful resources\n",
    "* For more details, take a look at [our paper on forecasting with sktime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08067) in which we discuss the forecasting API in more detail and use it to replicate and extend the M4 study.\n",
    "* For a good introduction to forecasting, see [Hyndman, Rob J., and George Athanasopoulos. Forecasting: principles and practice. OTexts, 2018](https://otexts.com/fpp2/).\n",
    "* For comparative benchmarking studies/forecasting competitions, see the [M4 competition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301128) and the [M5 competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/overview)."
