Most forecasters that can deal with exogeneous time series will assume that the time indices of `X` passed to `fit` are a super-set of the time indices in `y` passed to `fit`; and that the time indices of `X` passed to `predict` are a super-set of time indices in `fh`, although this is not a general interface restriction.

    "It is good practice to evaluate statistical performance of a forecaster before deploying it, and regularly re-evaluate performance if in continuous deployment. The evaluation workflow for the basic batch forecasting task, as solved by the workflow in Section 1.2, consists of comparing batch forecasts with actuals. This is sometimes called (batch-wise) backtesting.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. splitting a representatively chosen historical series into a temporal training and test set. The test set should be temporally in the future of the training set.\n",

    "5. testing whether this performance is statistically better than a chosen baseline performance\n",

Results are only insofar representative as future performance can be assumed to mirror past performance.

Monitoring of forecasting performance is hence advised in case an algorithm is applied multiple times."

This is then considered as an indication of how well the forecaster would perform in the coming 3 years (what was done in Section 1.2).

    "\n",
    "`sktime` also provides capabilities for automated selection of pipeline components *inside* a pipeline, i.e., pipeline structure. This is achieved with the `OptionalPassthrough` transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OptionalPassthrough` transformer allows to tune whether a transformer inside a pipeline is applied to the data or not. For example, if we want to tune whether `sklearn.StandardScaler` is bringing an advantage to the forecast or not, we wrap it in `OptionalPassthrough`. Internally, `OptionalPassthrough` has a hyperparameter `passthrough: bool` that is tuneable; when `False` the composite behaves like the wrapped transformer, when `True`, it ignores the transformer within.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make effective use of `OptionalPasstrhough`, define a suitable parameter set using the `__` (double underscore) notation familiar from `scikit-learn`. This allows to access and tune attributes of nested objects like TabularToSeriesAdaptor(StandardScaler()). We can use `__` multiple times if we have more than two levels of nesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we take a deseasonalize/scale pipeline and tune over the four possible combinations of deseasonalizer and scaler being included in the pipeline yes/no (2 times 2 = 4); as well as over the forecaster's and the scaler's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this could be arbitrarily combined with `MultiplexForecaster`, as in Section 3.4.1, to select over pipeline architecture as well as over pipeline structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `scikit-learn` and `sktime` do not support conditional parameter sets at current (unlike, e.g., the `mlr3` package). This means that the grid search will optimize over the `scaler`'s parameters even when it is skipped. Designing/implementing this capability would be an interesting area for contributions or research."

    "1. read through the [forecasting extension template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/forecasting.py) - this is a `python` file with `todo` blocks that mark the places in which changes need to be added.\n",
    "2. optionally, if you are planning any major surgeries to the interface: look at the [base class architecture](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/base/_base.py) - note that \"ordinary\" extension (e.g., new algorithm) should be easily doable without this.\n",
    "3. copy the forecasting extension template to a local folder in your own repository (local/private extension), or to a suitable location in your clone of the `sktime` or affiliated repository (if contributed extension), inside `sktime.forecasting`; rename the file and update the file docstring appropriately.\n",
    "4. address the \"todo\" parts. Usually, this means: changing the name of the class, setting the tag values, specifying hyper-parameters, filling in `__init__`, `_fit`, `_predict`, and optional methods such as `_update` (for details see the extension template). You can add private methods as long as they do not override the default public interface. For more details, see the extension template.\n",
    "5. to test your estimator manually: import your estimator and run it in the worfklows in Section 1; then use it in the compositors in Section 3.\n",
    "6. to test your estimator automatically: call `sktime.tests.test_all_estimators.test_estimator` on your estimator - note that the function takes the class, not an object instance. Before the call, you need to register the new estimator in `sktime.tests._config`, as an import, and by adding default parameter settings to the `ESTIMATOR_TEST_PARAMS` variable (the `dict` entry `key` is the class, and entry is a `scikit-learn` parameter set). `pytest` will also add the call to its automated tests in a working clone of the `sktime` repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of direct contribution to `sktime` or one of its affiliated packages, additionally:\n",
    "* add yourself as an author to the code, and to the `CODEOWNERS` for the new estimator file(s).\n",
    "* create a pull request that contains only the new estimators (and their inheritance tree, if it's not just one class), as well as the automated tests as described above.\n",
    "* in the pull request, describe the estimator and optimally provide a publication or other technical reference for the strategy it implements.\n",
