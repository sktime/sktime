    "\n",
    "A common mistake is to mis-identify a forecasting problem as supervised regression - after all, in both we predict numbers, so surely this must be the same thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed we predict numbers in both, but the set-up is different:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In supervised regression, we predict *label/target variables* from *feature variables*, in a cross-sectional set-up. This is after training on label/feature examples.\n",

    "\n",
    "* In supervised regression, we predict entries in a column from other columns. For this, we mainly make use of the statistical relation between those columns, learnt from examples of complete rows. The rows are all assumed exchangeable.\n",
    "* In forecasting, we predict new rows, assuming temporal ordering in the rows. For this, we mainly make use of the statistical relation between previous and subsequent rows, learnt from the example of the observed sequence of rows. The rows are not exchangeable, but in temporal sequence."

    "Confusing the two tasks may lead to information leakage, and over-optimistic performance evaluation. This is because in supervised regression the ordering of rows does not matter, and train/test split is usually performed uniformly. In forecasting, the ordering does matter, both in training and in evaluation.\n",
