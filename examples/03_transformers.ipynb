    "* Follow the [\"implementing estimator\" developer guide](https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/developer_guide/add_estimators.html)\n",
    "* Use the [simple forecasting extension template](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/transformer_simple.py) for transformers without stream, probabilistic, or hierarchical functionality\n",
    "* Use the [advanced forecasting extension template](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/transformer.py) for transformers with stream, probabilistic or hierarchical functionality\n",
    "* For pairwise transformers, use the [time series pairwise transformer extension template](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/dist_kern_panel.py) or the [scalar/tabular pairwise transformer extension template](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/dist_kern_tab.py)\n",

    "2. optionally, if you are planning any major surgeries to the interface: look at the [base class architecture](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/transformations/base.py) - note that \"ordinary\" extension (e.g., new algorithm) should be easily doable without this.\n",
    "3. copy the correct transformer extension template to a local folder in your own repository (local/private extension), or to a suitable location in your clone of the `sktime` or affiliated repository (if contributed extension), inside `sktime.transformations`; rename the file and update the file docstring appropriately.\n",
    "4. address the \"todo\" parts. Usually, this means: changing the name of the class, setting the tag values, specifying hyper-parameters, filling in `__init__`, `_fit`, `_transform`, and optional methods such as `_inverse_transform` or `_update` (for details see the extension template). You can add private methods as long as they do not override the default public interface. For more details, see the extension template.\n",
    "5. to test your estimator manually: import your estimator and run it in the worfklows in Section 1; then use it in the compositors in Section 3.\n",
    "6. To test your estimator automatically: call `sktime.utils.estimator_checks.check_estimator` on your estimator. You can call this on a class or object instance. Ensure you have specified test parameters in the `get_test_params` method, according to the extension template.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of direct contribution to `sktime` or one of its affiliated packages, additionally:\n",
    "* add yourself as an author to the code, and to the `CODEOWNERS` for the new estimator file(s).\n",
    "* create a pull request that contains only the new estimators (and their inheritance tree, if it's not just one class), as well as the automated tests as described above.\n",
