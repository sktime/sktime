    "### Content of this Notebook:\n",
    "* Understanding what are graphical pipelines\n",
    "* Understanding the API of graphical pipelines\n",
    "* Examples of simple pipelines and how they can be implemented with graphical pipelines.\n",
    "* More complex graphical pipeline (Forecasting + GridSearch)\n",

    "### What are Graphical Pipelines?\n",
    "Recap sequential pipelines:\n",

    "<img src=\"img/sequential_pipeline.png\" width=750 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Many tasks are non-sequential. To solve this two possibilities exist:\n",
    "1. Nesting Sequential Pipelines.\n",
    "2. Using Graphical Pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, there is the generalised graphial pipeline.\n",
    "* Graphical means that different steps may share the same predecessor or provide their outputs to the same successor (the dataflows can branch and merge).\n",
    "<img src=\"img/graphical_pipeline.png\" width=750 />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generalised means that the pipeline can be used for multiple tasks (e.g. forecasting, classification, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphical pipeline is a new feature, Thus, if you are considering any issues, we would be happy to get feedback on the graphical pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Use-Cases\n",
    "There exist various potential use-case for the graphical pipeline. In the following, we focus on a forecasting and a classification pipeline.\n",
    "#### Forecasting Use-Case for Graphical Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The input of forecasters depends on the output of other forecasters, which same the same input.\n",
    "* Forecaster could use the same preprocessing (branching of data flow)\n",
    "* Forecaster could use outputs of multiple predeccessors (merging of data flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/graphical_pipeline_example.png\" width=900 />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The current experimental state of the graphical pipeline does not fully support this use-case. However, we are working on this. If you are interested in this use-case and want to contribute, please contact us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credits\n",
    "The graphical pipeline was first developed by pyWATTS [1] and was then adapted for sktime. The original implementation can be found [pyWATTS](https://github.com/KIT-IAI/pyWATTS). pyWATTS is a open source library developed at the Institute of Applied Informatics and Automation at the KIT and funded by HelmholtzAI.\n",
