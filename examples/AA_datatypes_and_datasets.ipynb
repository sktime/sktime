    "* the *data scientific abstract data type* - or short: **scitype** - of a data container, defined by relational and statistical properties of the data being represented and common operations on it - for instance, an abstract \"time series\" or an abstract \"time series panel\", without specifying a particular machine implementation in python\n",
    "* the *machine implementation type* - or short: **mtype** - of a data container, which, for a defined *scitype*, specifies the python type and conventions on structure and value of the python in-memory object. For instance, a concrete (mathematical) time series is represented by a concrete `pandas.DataFrame` in `sktime`, subject to certain conventions on the `pandas.DataFrame`. Formally, these conventions form a specific mtype, i.e., a way to represent the (abstract) \"time series\" scitype.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `sktime`, the same scitype can be implemented by multiple mtypes. For instance, `sktime` allows the user to specify time series as `pandas.DataFrame`, as `pandas.Series`, or as a `numpy.ndarray`. These are different mtypes which are admissible representations of the same scitype, \"time series\". Also, not all mtypes are equally rich in metadata - for instance, `pandas.DataFrame` can store column names, while this is not possible in `numpy.ndarray`.\n",
