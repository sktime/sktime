    "# Dictionary based time series classification in sktime\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary based approaches adapt the bag of words model commonly used in signal processing, computer vision and audio processing for time series classification.\n",
    "Dictionary based classifiers have the same broad structure.\n",
    "A sliding window of length $w$ is run across a series.\n",
    "For each window, the real valued series of length $w$ is converted through approximation and discretisation processes into a symbolic string of length $l$, which consists of $\\alpha$ possible letters.\n",
    "The occurrence in a series of each 'word' from the dictionary defined by $l$ and $\\alpha$ is counted, and once the sliding window has completed the series is transformed into a histogram.\n",
    "Classification is based on the histograms of the words extracted from the series, rather than the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently 4 univeriate dictionary based classifiers are implemented in sktime, all making use of the Symbolic Fourier Approximation (SFA)\\[1\\] transform to discretise into words.\n",
    "These are the Bag of SFA Symbols (BOSS)\\[2\\], the Contractable Bag of SFA Symbols (cBOSS)\\[3\\], Word Extraction for Time Series Classification  (WEASEL)\\[4\\] and the Temporal Dictionary Ensemble (TDE)\\[5\\]. WEASEL has a multivariate extension called MUSE\\[7\\] and TDE has multivariate capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use BOSS, cBOSS, WEASEL and TDE on the ItalyPowerDemand and JapaneseVowels datasets.\n",
