    r"""Interface to sktime native dtw aligners, with derivative or weighting.

    Interface to simple dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment,
    and the following weighted/derivative versions:

    * WDTW - weighted dynamic tyme warping - ``weighted=True, derivative=False`
    * DDTW - derivative dynamic time warping - ``weighted=False, derivative=True``
    * WDDTW - weighted derivative dynamic time
      warping - ``weighted=True, derivative=True``

    ``sktime`` interface to the efficient ``numba`` implementations
    provided by ``distance_alignment_path`` in ``sktime.distances``.

    This estimator provides performant implementation of time warping for:
    * time series of equal length
    * the Euclidean pairwise distance

    For unequal length time series, use ``sktime.aligners.AlignerDTW``.
    To use arbitrary pairwise distances, use ``sktime.aligners.AlignerDTWfromDist``.
    (for derivative DTW, pipeline an alignment distance with ``Differencer``)

    The distances are also available in ``sktime.dists_kernels.dtw``
    as pairwise transformers.

    Note that the more flexible options above may be less performant.

    DTW was originally proposed in [1]_, DTW computes the distance between two
    time series by considering their alignments during the calculation.
    This is done by measuring
    the pointwise distance (normally using Euclidean) between all elements of the two
    time series and then using dynamic programming to find the warping path
    that minimises the total pointwise distance between realigned series.

    DDTW is an adaptation of DTW originally proposed in [2]_. DDTW attempts to
    improve on dtw by better account for the 'shape' of the time series.
    This is done by considering y axis data points as higher level features of 'shape'.
    To do this the first derivative of the sequence is taken, and then using this
    derived sequence a dtw computation is done.

    WDTW was first proposed in [3]_, it adds a multiplicative weight penalty based on
    the warping distance. This means that time series with lower phase difference have
    a smaller weight imposed (i.e less penalty imposed) and time series with larger
    phase difference have a larger weight imposed (i.e. larger penalty imposed).

    WDDTW was first proposed in [3]_ as an extension of DDTW. By adding a weight
    to the derivative it means the alignment isn't only considering the shape of the
    time series, but also the phase.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weighted : bool, optional, default=False
        whether a weighted version of the distance is computed
        False = unmodified distance, i.e., dtw distance or derivative dtw distance
        True = weighted distance, i.e., weighted dtw or derivative weighted dtw
    derivative : bool, optional, default=False
        whether the distance or the derivative distance is computed
        False = unmodified distance, i.e., dtw distance or weighted dtw distance
        True = derivative distance, i.e., derivative dtw distance or derivative wdtw
    window: int, defaults = None
        Sakoe-Chiba window radius
        one of three mutually exclusive ways to specify bounding matrix
        if ``None``, does not use Sakoe-Chiba window
        if ``int``, uses Sakoe-Chiba lower bounding window with radius ``window``.
        If ``window`` is passed, ``itakura_max_slope`` will be ignored.
    itakura_max_slope: float, between 0. and 1., default = None
        Itakura parallelogram slope
        one of three mutually exclusive ways to specify bounding matrix
        if ``None``, does not use Itakura parallelogram lower bounding
        if ``float``, uses Itakura parallelogram lower bounding,
        with slope gradient ``itakura_max_slope``
    bounding_matrix: optional, 2D np.ndarray, default=None
        one of three mutually exclusive ways to specify bounding matrix
        must be of shape ``(len(X), len(X2))``, ``len`` meaning number time points,
        where ``X``, ``X2`` are the two time series passed in transform
        Custom bounding matrix to use.
        If provided, then ``window`` and ``itakura_max_slope`` are ignored.
        The matrix should be structured so that indexes considered in
        bound should be the value 0. and indexes outside the bounding matrix should
        be infinity.
    g: float, optional, default = 0. Used only if ``weighted=True``.
        Constant that controls the curvature (slope) of the function;
        that is, ``g`` controls the level of penalisation for the points
        with larger phase difference.
