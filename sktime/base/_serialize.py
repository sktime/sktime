class _SerializationMixin:
    """Mixin containing serialization API for sktime base objects."""

    def save(self, path=None, serialization_format="pickle"):
        """Save serialized self to bytes-like object or to (.zip) file.

        Behaviour:

        * if ``path`` is None, returns an in-memory serialized self
        * if ``path`` is a file location, stores self at that location as a zip file

        saved files are zip files with following contents:

        * ``_metadata`` - contains class of self, i.e., ``type(self)``
        * ``_obj`` - serialized self. This class uses the default serialization
          (pickle).

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : None or file location (str or Path)
            if None, self is saved to an in-memory object
            if file location, self is saved to that file location. If:

            - path="estimator" then a zip file ``estimator.zip`` will be made at cwd.
            - path="/home/stored/estimator" then a zip file ``estimator.zip`` will be
            stored in ``/home/stored/``.

        serialization_format: str, default = "pickle"
            Module to use for serialization.
            The available options are "pickle" and "cloudpickle".
            Note that non-default formats might require
            installation of other soft dependencies.

        Returns
        -------
        if ``path`` is None - in-memory serialized self
        if ``path`` is file location - ZipFile with reference to the file

            The name of the file without the extension, for e.g: if the file

    Examples
    --------
    Example 1: saving an estimator in-memory and loading it back

    >>> from sktime.datasets import load_airline
    >>> from sktime.forecasting.naive import NaiveForecaster
    >>>
    >>> # 1. fit the estimator
    >>> y = load_airline()
    >>> forecaster = NaiveForecaster()
    >>> forecaster.fit(y, fh=[1, 2, 3])
    NaiveForecaster()
    >>>
    >>> # 2. save the fitted estimator
    >>> pkl = forecaster.save()
    >>>
    >>> # 3. load the saved estimator (can do this on empty kernel)
    >>> from sktime.base import load
    >>> forecaster_loaded = load(pkl)
    >>>
    >>> # 4. continue using the loaded estimator
    >>> y_pred = forecaster_loaded.predict()

    Example 2: saving a deep learning estimator on the hard drive and loading

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sktime.classification.deep_learning import CNNClassifier
    >>>
    >>> # 1. fit the estimator
    >>> sample_X = np.random.randn(15, 24, 16) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> sample_y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(15, )) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> sample_test_X = np.random.randn(5, 24, 16) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> cnn = CNNClassifier(n_epochs=1) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> cnn.fit(sample_X, sample_y) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 2. save the fitted estimator
    >>> save_folder_location = "save_folder" # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> cnn.save(save_folder_location) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 3. load the saved estimator (can do this on empty kernel)
    >>> from sktime.base import load
    >>> save_folder_location = "save_folder" # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> loaded_cnn = load(save_folder_location) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 4. continue using the loaded estimator
    >>> pred = cnn.predict(X=sample_test_X) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> loaded_pred = loaded_cnn.predict(X=sample_test_X) # doctest: +SKIP

    Example 3:  saving an estimator using cloudpickle's serialization functionality
                and loading it back
        Note: `cloudpickle` is a soft dependency and is not present
        with the base-installation.

    >>> from sktime.classification.feature_based import Catch22Classifier
    >>> from sktime.datasets import load_basic_motions  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>

    >>> X_test, y_test = load_basic_motions(split="TEST")  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> est = Catch22Classifier().fit(X_train, y_train)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 2. save the fitted estimator
    >>> cpkl_serialized = est.save(serialization_format="cloudpickle")  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 3. load the saved estimator (possibly after sending it across a stream)
    >>> from sktime.base import load  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> loaded_est = load(cpkl_serialized)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 4. continue using the estimator as normal

    >>> loaded_pred = loaded_est.predict(X_test)  # doctest: +SKIP
