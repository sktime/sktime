"""Utilities for serializing and deserializing objects.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT FOR DEVELOPERS:
Do not add estimator specific functionality to the `load` utility.
All estimator specific functionality should be in
the class methods `load_from_serial` and `load_from_path`.

def load(serial):
    """Load an object either from in-memory object or from a file location.

    Parameters
    ----------
    serial : serialized container (tuple), str (path), or Path object (reference)
        if serial is a tuple (serialized container):
            Contains two elements, first in-memory metadata and second
            the related object.
        if serial is a string (path reference):
            The name of the file without the extension, for e.g: if the file
            is `estimator.zip`, `serial='estimator'`. It can also represent a
            path, for eg: if location is `home/stored/models/estimator.zip`
            then `serial='home/stored/models/estimator'`.
        if serial is a Path object (path reference):
            `serial` then points to the `.zip` file into which the
            object was stored using class method `.save()` of an estimator.

    Returns
    -------
    Deserialized self resulting in output `serial`, of `cls.save`

    Examples
    --------
    Example 1: saving an estimator as pickle and loading
    >>> from sktime.datasets import load_airline
    >>> from sktime.forecasting.naive import NaiveForecaster
    >>>
    >>> # 1. fit the estimator
    >>> y = load_airline()
    >>> forecaster = NaiveForecaster()
    >>> forecaster.fit(y, fh=[1, 2, 3])
    >>>
    >>> # 2. save the fitted estimator
    >>> pkl = forecaster.save()
    >>>
    >>> # 3. load the saved estimator (can do this on empty kernel)
    >>> from sktime.base import load
    >>> forecaster_loaded = load(pkl)
    >>>
    >>> # 4. continue using the loaded estimator
    >>> y_pred = forecaster_loaded.predict()

    Example 2: saving a deep learning estimator on the hard drive and loading
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sktime.classification.deep_learning import CNNClassifier
    >>>
    >>> # 1. fit the estimator
    >>> sample_X = np.random.randn(15, 24, 16) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> sample_y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(15, )) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> sample_test_X = np.random.randn(5, 24, 16) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> cnn = CNNClassifier(n_epochs=1) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> cnn.fit(sample_X, sample_y) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 2. save the fitted estimator
    >>> save_folder_location = "save_folder" # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> cnn.save(save_folder_location) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 3. load the saved estimator (can do this on empty kernel)
    >>> from sktime.base import load
    >>> save_folder_location = "save_folder" # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> loaded_cnn = load(save_folder_location) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>>
    >>> # 4. continue using the loaded estimator
    >>> pred = cnn.predict(X=sample_test_X) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> loaded_pred = loaded_cnn.predict(X=sample_test_X) # doctest: +SKIP
