"""Minimal library of kotsu methods still used in sktime.

PRIVATE MODULE: NOT FOR USE OUTSIDE OF DIRECT CALLS FROM SKTIME.

This library is a minimal, stripped down version of the kotsu library
that covers remaining imports from sktime's benchmarking module.

The module is currently undergoing a refactor with the following targets:

* remove kotsu as a soft dependeny. The package is no longer maintained and
  a dependency liability for sktime, maintainers are non-responsive.
* replace kotsu with sktime's own benchmarking module, with an API that is closer
  to sklearn's estimator API (e.g., no separation of class and params).
* the refactor should cover both the time series classification benchmarks module,
  which is a native sktime implementation,
  and the newer forecasting benchmarks module, which used kotsu.
* retain proper credit to the original authors of kotsu, beyond their direct
  contributions to sktime, following open source and academic standards of crediting.
