    This dataset involves one female actor and one male actor making a
    motion with their
    hand. The two classes are: Gun-Draw and Point: For Gun-Draw the actors
    have their
    hands by their sides. They draw a replicate gun from a hip-mounted
    holster, point it
    at a target for approximately one second, then return the gun to the
    holster, and
    their hands to their sides. For Point the actors have their gun by their
    sides.
    They point with their index fingers to a target for approximately one
    second, and
    then return their hands to their sides. For both classes, we tracked the
    centroid
    of the actor's right hands in both X- and Y-axes, which appear to be highly
    correlated. The data in the archive is just the X-axis.

    A UCI Archive dataset. 9 Japanese-male speakers were recorded saying
    the vowels 'a' and 'e'. A '12-degree
    linear prediction analysis' is applied to the raw recordings to
    obtain time-series with 12 dimensions and series lengths between 7 and 29.
    The classification task is to predict the speaker. Therefore,
    each instance is a transformed utterance,
    12*29 values with a single class label attached, [1...9]. The given
    training set is comprised of 30
    utterances for each speaker, however the test set has a varied
    distribution based on external factors of
    timing and experimental availability, between 24 and 88 instances per
    speaker. Reference: M. Kudo, J. Toyama

    The annual numbers of lynx trappings for 1821â1934 in Canada. This
    time-series records the number of skins of
    predators (lynx) that were collected over several years by the Hudson's
    Bay Company. The dataset was
    taken from Brockwell & Davis (1991) and appears to be the series
    considered by Campbell & Walker (1977).

    Dimensionality:     univariate
    Series length:      114
    Frequency:          Yearly
    Number of cases:    1

    This data shows aperiodic, cyclical patterns, as opposed to periodic,
    seasonal patterns.
