    This is done by considering y axis data points as higher level features of 'shape'.
    To do this the first derivative of the sequence is taken, and then using this
    derived sequence a dtw computation is done.

    The default derivative used is:

    r"""Compute the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between two time series.

    Originally proposed in [1]_, DTW is an elastic
    distance measure, i.e., it is a distance computed after realigning (warping)
    two time series to best match each other via time axis distortions [2]_.

    This function computes time warping distances only for:
    * sequences, time index is ignored
    * two time series of equal length
    * the Euclidean pairwise distance

    For unequal length time series, use `sktime.dists_kernels.DistFromAligner`
    with a time warping aligner such as `sktime.aligners.AlignerDTW`.
    To use arbitrary pairwise distances, use `sktime.aligners.AlignerDTWfromDist`.

    Mathematically, for two sequences
    :math:'\mathbf{a}=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m\}' and :math:'\mathbf{b}=\{b_1,b_2,\ldots,
    b_n\}',  (assumed equal length for simplicity), DTW first calculates
    the pairwise distance matrix :math:'M(
    \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})', the :math:'m \times n',
    between series :math:'\mathbf{a}' and :math:'\mathbf{b}',
    where :math:'M_{i,j} = d(a_i, b_j)', for a chosen distance measure
    :math:`d: \mathbb{R}^h \times \mathbb{R}^h \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`.
    In this estimator, the squared Euclidean distance is used, i.e.,
    :math:`d(x, y):= (x-y)^2`. A warping path
    .. math::  P=((i_1, j_1), (i_2, j_2), \ldots, (i_s, j_s))
    is an ordered tuple of indices
    :math:`i_k \in \{1, \dots, m\}, j_k \in \{1, \dots, n\}`
    which define a traversal path of matrix :math:'M'.
    This implementation assumes for warping paths that:
    * closed paths: :math:`i_1 = j_1 = 1`; :math:`i_s = m, j_s = n`
    * monotonous paths: :math:`i_k \le i_{k+1}, j_k \le j_{k+1}` for all :math:`k`
    * strictly monotonous paths: :math:`(i_k, j_k) \neq (i_{k+1}, j_{k+1})` for all :math:`k`
    The DTW path between sequences is the path through :math:'M' that minimizes the total distance,
    over all valid paths (satisfying the above assumptions), given the sequences.
    Formally:
    The distance for a warping path :math:'P' of length :math:'s' is
    .. math::  D_P(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) = \sum_{k=1}^s M_{i_k,j_k}.
    If :math:'\mathcal{P}' is the set of all possible paths, the DTW path :math:'P^*'
    is the path that has the minimum distance amongst those:
    .. math::  P^* = \argmin_{P\in \mathcal{P}} D_{P}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}).
    The DTW distance between the two sequences :math:'\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}' is
    the minimum warping path distance:
    .. math::  d_{dtw}(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) = \min_{P\in \mathcal{P}} D_{P}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) = D_{P^*}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}).
    The optimal warping path $P^*$ can be found exactly through dynamic programming.
    This can be a time consuming operation, and it is common to put a
    restriction on the amount of warping allowed. This is implemented through
    the `bounding_matrix` structure, that restricts allowable warpings by a mask.
    Common bounding strategies include the Sakoe-Chiba band [3]_ and the Itakura
    parallelogram [4_]. The Sakoe-Chiba band creates a warping path window that has
    the same width along the diagonal of :math:'M'. The Itakura paralleogram allows
    for less warping at the start or end of the sequence than in the middle.

    If the function is called with multivariate time series, note that
    the matrix :math:'M' is computed with the multivariate squared Euclidean distance,
    :math:`d(x, y):= (x-y)^2` = \sum_{i=1}^h (x_i - y_i)^2`
    This is sometimes called the "dependent" version of DTW, DTW_D, see [5]_.

    Originally proposed in [1]_ DTW computes the distance between two time series by
    considering their alignments during the calculation. This is done by measuring
    the pointwise distance (normally using Euclidean) between all elements of the two
    time series and then using dynamic programming to find the warping path
    that minimises the total pointwise distance between realigned series.

    Mathematically dtw can be defined as:
