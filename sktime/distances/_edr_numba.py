    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray, 2d shape (d (n_dimensions),m (series_length))
        First time series.
    y: np.ndarray, 2d array shape (d, m)
        Second time series.
    bounding_matrix: np.ndarray (2d of size mxn where m is len(x) and n is len(y))
        Bounding matrix where the values in bound are marked by finite values and
        outside bound points are infinite values.
    epsilon : float
        Matching threshold to determine if distance between two subsequences are
        considered similar (similar if distance less than the threshold).

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray (2d of size mxn where m is len(x) and n is len(y))
        Edr cost matrix between x and y.
