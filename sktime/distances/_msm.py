class _MsmDistance(NumbaDistance):
    r"""Move-split-merge (MSM) distance between two time series.

    (MSM) [1] is a distance measure that is conceptually similar to other edit
    distance-based approaches, where similarity is calculated by using a set of
    operations to transform one series into another. Each operation has an
    associated cost, and three operations are defined for MSM: move, split, and merge.
    Move is synonymous with a substitution operation, where one value is replaced by
    another. Split and merge differ from other approaches, as they attempt to add
    context to insertions and deletions. The cost of inserting and deleting values
    depends on the value itself and adjacent values, rather than treating all
    insertions and deletions equally (for example, as in ERP). Therefore, the split
    operation is introduced to insert an identical copy of a value immediately after
    itself, and the merge operation is used to delete a value if it directly follows
    an identical value.

    Currently only works with univariate series.
