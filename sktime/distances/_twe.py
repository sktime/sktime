    """Time Warp Edit (TWE) distance between two time series.

    The Time Warp Edit (TWE) distance is a distance measure for discrete time series
    matching with time 'elasticity'. In comparison to other distance measures, (e.g.
    DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) or LCS (Longest Common Subsequence Problem)), TWE is a
    metric. Its computational time complexity is O(n^2), but can be drastically reduced
    in some specific situation by using a corridor to reduce the search space. Its
    memory space complexity can be reduced to O(n). It was first proposed in [1].

        Parameters
        ----------
        x: np.ndarray (2d array of shape (d,m1)).
            First time series.
        y: np.ndarray (2d array of shape (d,m2)).
            Second time series.
        return_cost_matrix: bool, defaults = False
            Boolean that when true will also return the cost matrix.
        window: Float, defaults = None
            Float that is the radius of the sakoe chiba window (if using Sakoe-Chiba
            lower bounding). Must be between 0 and 1.
        itakura_max_slope: float, defaults = None
            Gradient of the slope for itakura parallelogram (if using Itakura
            Parallelogram lower bounding). Must be between 0 and 1.
        bounding_matrix: np.ndarray (2d array of shape (m1,m2)), defaults = None
            Custom bounding matrix to use. If defined then other lower_bounding params
            are ignored. The matrix should be structure so that indexes considered in
            bound should be the value 0. and indexes outside the bounding matrix should
            be infinity.
        lmbda: float, defaults = 1.0
            A constant penalty that punishes the editing efforts. Must be >= 1.0.
        nu: float, defaults = 0.001
            A non-negative constant which characterizes the stiffness of the elastic
            twe measure. Must be > 0.
        p: int, defaults = 2
            Order of the p-norm for local cost.
        kwargs: any
            extra kwargs.

        Returns
        -------
        Callable[[np.ndarray, np.ndarray], float]
            No_python compiled Dtw distance callable.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the input time series are not numpy array.
            If the input time series do not have exactly 2 dimensions.
            If the sakoe_chiba_window_radius is not an integer.
