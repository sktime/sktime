class _TweDistance(NumbaDistance):
    """Time Warp Edit (TWE) distance between two time series.

    The Time Warp Edit (TWE) distance is a distance measure for discrete time series
    matching with time 'elasticity'. In comparison to other distance measures, (e.g.
    DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) or LCS (Longest Common Subsequence Problem)), TWE is a
    metric. Its computational time complexity is O(n^2), but can be drastically reduced
    in some specific situation by using a corridor to reduce the search space. Its
    memory space complexity can be reduced to O(n). It was first proposed in [1].
