class _WdtwDistance(NumbaDistance):
    r"""Weighted dynamic time warping (WDTW) distance between two time series.

    WDTW uses DTW with a weighted pairwise distance matrix rather than a window. When
    creating the distance matrix :math:'M', a weight penalty  :math:'w_{|i-j|}' for a
    warping distance of :math:'|i-j|' is applied, so that for series
    :math:'a = <a_1, ..., a_m>' and :math:'b=<b_1,...,b_m>',
    .. math:: M_{i,j}=  w(|i-j|) (a_i-b_j)^2.
    A logistic weight function, proposed in [1] is used, so that a warping of :math:'x'
    places imposes a weighting of
    .. math:: w(x)=\frac{w_{max}}{1+e^{-g(x-m/2)}},
    where :math:'w_{max}' is an upper bound on the weight (set to 1), :math:'m' is
    the series length and :math:'g' is a parameter that controls the penalty level
    for larger warpings. The greater :math:'g' is, the greater the penalty for warping.
    Once :math:'M' is found, standard dynamic time warping is applied.

    WDTW is set up so you can use it with a bounding box in addition to the weight
    function is so desired. This is for consistency with the other distance functions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x: np.ndarray (2d array of shape (d,m1)).
            First time series.
        y: np.ndarray (2d array of shape (d,m2)).
            Second time series.
        return_cost_matrix: bool, defaults = False
            Boolean that when true will also return the cost matrix.
        window: Float, defaults = None
            Float that is the radius of the sakoe chiba window (if using Sakoe-Chiba
            lower bounding). Must be between 0 and 1.
        itakura_max_slope: float, defaults = None
            Gradient of the slope for itakura parallelogram (if using Itakura
            Parallelogram lower bounding). Must be between 0 and 1.
        bounding_matrix: np.ndarray (2d array of shape (m1,m2)), defaults = None
            Custom bounding matrix to use. If defined then other lower_bounding params
            are ignored. The matrix should be structure so that indexes considered in
            bound should be the value 0. and indexes outside the bounding matrix should
            be infinity.
        g: float, defaults = 0.
            Constant that controls the curvature (slope) of the function; that is, g
            controls the level of penalisation for the points with larger phase
            difference.
        kwargs: any
            extra kwargs.

        Returns
        -------
        Callable[[np.ndarray, np.ndarray], tuple[np.ndarray, float]]
            No_python compiled wdtw distance path callable.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the input time series are not numpy array.
            If the input time series do not have exactly 2 dimensions.
            If the sakoe_chiba_window_radius is not an integer.
