    """Prophet forecaster by wrapping fbprophet.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq: String of DatetimeIndex frequency. See here for possible values:
        https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html
        #timeseries-offset-aliases
    add_seasonality: Dict or List of Dicts with args for Prophet.add_seasonality().
        Dict or each Dict in List can have the following keys/values:
            name: string name of the seasonality component.
            period: float number of days in one period.
            fourier_order: int number of Fourier components to use.
            prior_scale: optional float prior scale for this component.
            mode: optional 'additive' or 'multiplicative'
            condition_name: string name of the seasonality condition.
    add_country_holidays: Dict with args for Prophet.add_country_holidays().
        Dict can have the following keys/values:
            country_name: Name of the country, like 'UnitedStates' or 'US'
    growth: String 'linear' or 'logistic' to specify a linear or logistic
        trend.
    changepoints: List of dates at which to include potential changepoints. If
        not specified, potential changepoints are selected automatically.
    n_changepoints: Number of potential changepoints to include. Not used
        if input `changepoints` is supplied. If `changepoints` is not supplied,
        then n_changepoints potential changepoints are selected uniformly from
        the first `changepoint_range` proportion of the history.
    changepoint_range: Proportion of history in which trend changepoints will
        be estimated. Defaults to 0.8 for the first 80%. Not used if
        `changepoints` is specified.
    yearly_seasonality: Fit yearly seasonality.
        Can be 'auto', True, False, or a number of Fourier terms to generate.
    weekly_seasonality: Fit weekly seasonality.
        Can be 'auto', True, False, or a number of Fourier terms to generate.
    daily_seasonality: Fit daily seasonality.
        Can be 'auto', True, False, or a number of Fourier terms to generate.
    holidays: pd.DataFrame with columns holiday (string) and ds (date type)
        and optionally columns lower_window and upper_window which specify a
        range of days around the date to be included as holidays.
        lower_window=-2 will include 2 days prior to the date as holidays. Also
        optionally can have a column prior_scale specifying the prior scale for
        that holiday.
    seasonality_mode: 'additive' (default) or 'multiplicative'.
    seasonality_prior_scale: Parameter modulating the strength of the
        seasonality model. Larger values allow the model to fit larger seasonal
        fluctuations, smaller values dampen the seasonality. Can be specified
        for individual seasonalities using add_seasonality.
    holidays_prior_scale: Parameter modulating the strength of the holiday
        components model, unless overridden in the holidays input.
    changepoint_prior_scale: Parameter modulating the flexibility of the
        automatic changepoint selection. Large values will allow many
        changepoints, small values will allow few changepoints.
    mcmc_samples: Integer, if greater than 0, will do full Bayesian inference
        with the specified number of MCMC samples. If 0, will do MAP
        estimation.
    alpha: Float, width of the uncertainty intervals provided
        for the forecast. If mcmc_samples=0, this will be only the uncertainty
        in the trend using the MAP estimate of the extrapolated generative
        model. If mcmc.samples>0, this will be integrated over all model
        parameters, which will include uncertainty in seasonality.
    uncertainty_samples: Number of simulated draws used to estimate
        uncertainty intervals. Settings this value to 0 or False will disable
        uncertainty estimation and speed up the calculation.
    stan_backend: str as defined in StanBackendEnum default: None - will try to
        iterate over all available backends and find the working one
