NXAI COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT

Preamble 1

We are proud to present the NXAI TiRex time series model and software, demonstrating the strength of xLSTM for time series. While TiRex is freely available for open research and development, we believe that organizations significantly benefiting from our technology should contribute back. Our goal is to support research, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and open innovation, while ensuring that large enterprises who incorporate TiRex into commercial products or services fairly compensate the creators for their research and development efforts.
