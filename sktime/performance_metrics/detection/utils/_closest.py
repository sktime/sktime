"""Utility to find all closest elements in sorted list b to sorted list a."""


def _find_closest_elements(a, b):
    """Find the closest element in b for each element in a.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : 1D array-like
        An ordered (sorted) list of elements.
    b : 1D array-like
        Another ordered (sorted) list of elements.

    Returns
    -------
    closest : list, same length as a
        a list of closest elements in ``b`` for each element in ``a``.
        In case of ties, the first closest element is chosen.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = [1, 3, 5]
    >>> b = [2, 3.1, 3.2, 4, 6]
    >>> pointer = DirectedHausdorff()._find_closest_elements(a, b)
