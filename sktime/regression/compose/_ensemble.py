class TimeSeriesForestRegressor(BaseTimeSeriesForest, BaseRegressor):
    """Time-Series Forest Regressor.

    A time series forest is a meta estimator and an adaptation of the random
    forest for time-series/panel data that fits a number of decision tree
    regressors on various sub-samples of a transformed dataset and uses
    averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
    The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample size
    but the samples are drawn with replacement if `bootstrap=True` (default).

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : Pipeline
        A pipeline consisting of series-to-tabular transformations
        and a decision tree regressor as final estimator.
    n_estimators : integer, optional (default=100)
        The number of trees in the forest.
    criterion : string, optional (default="mse")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "mse" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance
        reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2 loss
        using the mean of each terminal node, "friedman_mse", which uses mean
        squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential splits,
        and "mae" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes the L1 loss
        using the median of each terminal node.
    max_depth : integer or None, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.
    min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.
    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.
    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default="auto")
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)` (same as "auto").
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.
    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
    min_impurity_decrease : float, optional (default=0.)
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.
        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::
            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.
    min_impurity_split : float, (default=1e-7)
        Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
        if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.
    bootstrap : boolean, optional (default=True)
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees.
    oob_score : bool (default=False)
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate
        the generalization accuracy.
    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.
    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.
    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.
    None, optional (default=None)
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
        multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
        order as the columns of y.
        Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be
        defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example,
        for four-class multilabel classification weights should be
        [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of
        [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].
        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``
        The "balanced_subsample" mode is the same as "balanced" except that
        weights are computed based on the bootstrap sample for every tree
        grown.
        For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.
        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeRegressor
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.
    n_features_ : int
        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.
    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.
    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances (the higher, the more important the feature).

        Decision function computed with out-of-bag estimate on the training
        set. If n_estimators is small it might be possible that a data point

        `oob_decision_function_` might contain NaN.
    class_weight: dict, list of dicts, "balanced", "balanced_subsample" or \
        None, optional (default=None)
        Not needed here, added in the constructor to align with base class \
