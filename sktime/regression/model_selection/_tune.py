class TSRGridSearchCV(_DelegatedRegressor):
    """Exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator.

    Adapts sklearn GridSearchCV for sktime time series regressors

    Optimizes hyper-parameters of `estimators` by exhaustive grid search.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object
        This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface.
        Either estimator needs to provide a ``score`` function,
        or ``scoring`` must be passed.

    param_grid : dict or list of dictionaries
        Dictionary with parameters names (`str`) as keys and lists of
        parameter settings to try as values, or a list of such
        dictionaries, in which case the grids spanned by each dictionary
        in the list are explored. This enables searching over any sequence
        of parameter settings.

    scoring : str, callable, list, tuple or dict, default=None
        Strategy to evaluate the performance of the cross-validated model on
        the test set.

        If `scoring` represents a single score, one can use:

        - a single string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`);
        - a callable (see :ref:`scoring`) that returns a single value.

        If `scoring` represents multiple scores, one can use:

        - a list or tuple of unique strings;
        - a callable returning a dictionary where the keys are the metric
          names and the values are the metric scores;
        - a dictionary with metric names as keys and callables a values.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    refit : bool, str, or callable, default=True
        Refit an estimator using the best found parameters on the whole
        dataset. If ``False``, then ``predict`` will not work.

        For multiple metric evaluation, this needs to be a `str` denoting the
        scorer that would be used to find the best parameters for refitting
        the estimator at the end.

        Where there are considerations other than maximum score in
        choosing a best estimator, ``refit`` can be set to a function which
        returns the selected ``best_index_`` given ``cv_results_``. In that
        case, the ``best_estimator_`` and ``best_params_`` will be set
        according to the returned ``best_index_`` while the ``best_score_``
        attribute will not be available.

        The refitted estimator is made available at the ``best_estimator_``
        attribute and permits using ``predict`` directly on this
        ``GridSearchCV`` instance.

        Also for multiple metric evaluation, the attributes ``best_index_``,
        ``best_score_`` and ``best_params_`` will only be available if
        ``refit`` is set and all of them will be determined w.r.t this specific
        scorer.

        See ``scoring`` parameter to know more about multiple metric
        evaluation.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a regressor and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used. These splitters are instantiated
        with `shuffle=False` so the splits will be the same across calls.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    verbose : int
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

        - >1 : the computation time for each fold and parameter candidate is
          displayed;
        - >2 : the score is also displayed;
        - >3 : the fold and candidate parameter indexes are also displayed
          together with the starting time of the computation.

    pre_dispatch : int, or str, default='2*n_jobs'
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A str, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    error_score : 'raise' or numeric, default=np.nan
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error.

    return_train_score : bool, default=False
        If ``False``, the ``cv_results_`` attribute will not include training
        scores.
        Computing training scores is used to get insights on how different
        parameter settings impact the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.
        However computing the scores on the training set can be computationally
        expensive and is not strictly required to select the parameters that
        yield the best generalization performance.

    tune_by_variable : bool, optional (default=False)
        Whether to tune parameter by each time series variable separately,
        in case of multivariate data passed to the tuning estimator.
        Only applies if time series passed are strictly multivariate.
        If True, clones of the estimator will be fit to each variable separately,
        and are available in fields of the regressors_ attribute.
        Has the same effect as applying ColumnEnsembleRegressor wrapper to self.
        If False, the same best parameter is selected for all variables.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cv_results_ : dict of numpy (masked) ndarrays
        A dict with keys as column headers and values as columns, that can be
        imported into a pandas ``DataFrame``.

        For multi-metric evaluation, the scores for all the scorers are
        available in the ``cv_results_`` dict at the keys ending with that
        scorer's name (``'_<scorer_name>'``) instead of ``'_score'`` shown
        above. ('split0_test_precision', 'mean_train_precision' etc.)

    best_estimator_ : estimator
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if ``refit=False``.

        See ``refit`` parameter for more information on allowed values.

    best_score_ : float
        Mean cross-validated score of the best_estimator

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

        This attribute is not available if ``refit`` is a function.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    best_index_ : int
        The index (of the ``cv_results_`` arrays) which corresponds to the best
        candidate parameter setting.

        The dict at ``search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]`` gives
        the parameter setting for the best model, that gives the highest
        mean score (``search.best_score_``).

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    scorer_ : function or a dict
        Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
        parameters for the model.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this attribute holds the validated
        ``scoring`` dict which maps the scorer key to the scorer callable.

    n_splits_ : int
        The number of cross-validation splits (folds/iterations).

    refit_time_ : float
        Seconds used for refitting the best model on the whole dataset.

        This is present only if ``refit`` is not False.

    multimetric_ : bool
        Whether or not the scorers compute several metrics.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`. Only defined if
        `best_estimator_` is defined (see the documentation for the `refit`
        parameter for more details) and that `best_estimator_` exposes
        `n_features_in_` when fit.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Only defined if
        `best_estimator_` is defined (see the documentation for the `refit`
        parameter for more details) and that `best_estimator_` exposes
        `feature_names_in_` when fit.
