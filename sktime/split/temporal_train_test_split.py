    """Split time series data containers into a single train/test split.

    Creates a single train/test split of endogenous time series ``y``,
    an optionally exogeneous time series ``X``.

    Splits time series ``y`` into a single temporally ordered train and test split.
    The split is based on ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` parameters,
    which can signify fractions of total number of indices,
    or an absolute number of integers to cut.

    If the data contains multiple time series (Panel or Hierarchical),
    fractions and train-test sets will be computed per individual time series.

    If ``X`` is provided, will also produce a single train/test split of ``X``,
    at the same ``loc`` indices as ``y``. If non-``pandas`` based containers are used,
    will use ``iloc`` index instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : time series in sktime compatible data container format
        endogenous time series
    X : time series in sktime compatible data container format, optional, default=None
        exogenous time series
    test_size : float, int or None, optional (default=None)
        If float, must be between 0.0 and 1.0, and is interpreted as the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the test split. Proportions are rounded to the
        next higher integer count of samples (ceil).
        If int, is interpreted as total number of test samples.
        If None, the value is set to the complement of the train size.
        If ``train_size`` is also None, it will be set to 0.25.
    train_size : float, int, or None, (default=None)
        If float, must be between 0.0 and 1.0, and is interpreted as the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the train split. Proportions are rounded to the
        next lower integer count of samples (floor).
        If int, is interpreted as total number of train samples.
        If None, the value is set to the complement of the test size.
    fh : ForecastingHorizon
        A forecast horizon to use for splitting, alternative specification for test set.
        If given, ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` cannot also be specified and must
        be None. If ``fh`` is passed, the test set will be:
        if ``fh.is_relative``: the last possible indices to match ``fh`` within ``y``
        if ``not fh.is_relative``: the indices at the absolute index of ``fh``
    anchor : str, "start" (default) or "end"
        determines behaviour if train and test sizes do not sum up to all data
        used only if ``fh=None`` and both ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` are not None
        if "start", cuts train and test set from start of available series
        if "end", cuts train and test set from end of available series

    Returns
    -------
    splitting : tuple, length = 2 * len(arrays)
        Tuple containing train-test split of `y`, and `X` if given.
        if ``X is None``, returns ``(y_train, y_test)``.
        Else, returns ``(y_train, y_test, X_train, X_test)``.

    The function can also be applied to panel or hierarchical data,
    in this case the split will be applied per individual time series:
