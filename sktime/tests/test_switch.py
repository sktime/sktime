    This checks the following conditions:

    1. whether all required soft dependencies are present.
       If not, does not run the test.
       If yes, behaviour depends on ONLY_CHANGED_MODULES setting:
       if off (False), always runs the test (return True);
       if on (True), runs test if and only if
       at least one of conditions 2, 3, 4 below are met.

    2. Condition 2:

      If the module containing the class/func has changed according to is_class_changed,
      or one of the modules containing any parent classes in sktime,
      then condition 2 is met.

    3. Condition 3:

      If the object is an sktime ``BaseObject``, and one of the test classes
      covering the class have changed, then condition 3 is met.

    4. Condition 4:

      If the object is an sktime ``BaseObject``, and the package requirements
      for any of its dependencies have changed in ``pyproject.toml``,
      condition 4 is met.

    cls can also be a list of classes or functions,
    in this case the test is run if and only if both of the following are True:

    * all required soft dependencies are present
    * if ``ONLY_CHANGED_MODULES`` is True, additionally,
      if any of the estimators in the list should be tested by
      at least one of criteria 2-4 above.
      If ``ONLY_CHANGED_MODULES`` is False, this condition is always True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class, function or list of classes/functions
        class for which to determine whether it should be tested

    Returns
    -------
    bool : True if class should be tested, False otherwise
        if cls was a list, is True iff True for at least one of the classes in the list
