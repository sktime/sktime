Base class template for transformers.

    class name: BaseTransformer

Covers all types of transformers.
Type and behaviour of transformer is determined by the following tags:
    "scitype:transform-input" tag with values "Primitives" or "Series"
        this determines expected type of input of transform
        if "Primitives", expected inputs X are pd.DataFrame
        if "Series", expected inputs X are Series or Panel
        Note: placeholder tag for upwards compatibility
            currently only "Series" is supported
    "scitype:transform-output" tag with values "Primitives", or "Series"
        this determines type of output of transform
        if "Primitives", output is pd.DataFrame with as many rows as X has instances
            i-th instance of X is transformed into i-th row of output
        if "Series", output is a Series or Panel, with as many instances as X
            i-th instance of X is transformed into i-th instance of output
        Series are treated as one-instance-Panels
            if Series is input, output is a 1-row pd.DataFrame or a Series
    "scitype:instancewise" tag which is boolean
        if True, fit/transform is statistically independent by instance

Scitype defining methods:
    fitting         - fit(self, X, y=None)
    transform       - transform(self, X, y=None)
    fit&transform   - fit_transform(self, X, y=None)
    updating        - update(self, X, y=None)

Inspection methods:
    hyper-parameter inspection  - get_params()
    fitted parameter inspection - get_fitted_params()

State:
    fitted model/strategy   - by convention, any attributes ending in "_"
    fitted state flag       - is_fitted (property)
    fitted state inspection - check_is_fitted()

            |          | `transform`  |                        |
            |   `X`    |  `-output`   |     type of return     |
            |----------|--------------|------------------------|
            | `Series` | `Primitives` | `pd.DataFrame` (1-row) |
            | `Panel`  | `Primitives` | `pd.DataFrame`         |
            | `Series` | `Series`     | `Series`               |
            | `Panel`  | `Series`     | `Panel`                |
            | `Series` | `Panel`      | `Panel`                |
        instances in return correspond to instances in `X`
        combinations not in the table are currently not supported

        Explicitly, with examples:
            if `X` is `Series` (e.g., `pd.DataFrame`) and `transform-output` is `Series`
                then the return is a single `Series` of the same mtype
                Example: detrending a single series
            if `X` is `Panel` (e.g., `pd-multiindex`) and `transform-output` is `Series`
                then the return is `Panel` with same number of instances as `X`
                    (the transformer is applied to each input Series instance)
                Example: all series in the panel are detrended individually
            if `X` is `Series` or `Panel` and `transform-output` is `Primitives`
                then the return is `pd.DataFrame` with as many rows as instances in `X`
                Example: i-th row of the return has mean and variance of the i-th series
            if `X` is `Series` and `transform-output` is `Panel`
                then the return is a `Panel` object of type `pd-multiindex`
                Example: i-th instance of the output is the i-th window running over `X`

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : Series or Panel, any supported mtype
            Data to be transformed, of python type as follows:
                Series: pd.Series, pd.DataFrame, or np.ndarray (1D or 2D)
                Panel: pd.DataFrame with 2-level MultiIndex, list of pd.DataFrame,
                    nested pd.DataFrame, or pd.DataFrame in long/wide format
                subject to sktime mtype format specifications, for further details see

        y : Series or Panel, default=None
            Additional data, e.g., labels for transformation
        Z : possible alias for X; should not be passed when X is passed
            alias Z will be deprecated in version 0.10.0

        Returns
        -------
        transformed version of X
        type depends on type of X and scitype:transform-output tag:
            |   `X`    | `tf-output`  |     type of return     |
            |----------|--------------|------------------------|
            | `Series` | `Primitives` | `pd.DataFrame` (1-row) |
            | `Panel`  | `Primitives` | `pd.DataFrame`         |
            | `Series` | `Series`     | `Series`               |
            | `Panel`  | `Series`     | `Panel`                |
            | `Series` | `Panel`      | `Panel`                |
        instances in return correspond to instances in `X`
        combinations not in the table are currently not supported

        Explicitly, with examples:
            if `X` is `Series` (e.g., `pd.DataFrame`) and `transform-output` is `Series`
                then the return is a single `Series` of the same mtype
                Example: detrending a single series
            if `X` is `Panel` (e.g., `pd-multiindex`) and `transform-output` is `Series`
                then the return is `Panel` with same number of instances as `X`
                    (the transformer is applied to each input Series instance)
                Example: all series in the panel are detrended individually
            if `X` is `Series` or `Panel` and `transform-output` is `Primitives`
                then the return is `pd.DataFrame` with as many rows as instances in `X`
                Example: i-th row of the return has mean and variance of the i-th series
            if `X` is `Series` and `transform-output` is `Panel`
                then the return is a `Panel` object of type `pd-multiindex`
                Example: i-th instance of the output is the i-th window running over `X`
