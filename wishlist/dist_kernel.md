# Distance & Kernel Wishlist

Wishlist of pairwise distance and kernel algorithms for time series requested for implementation in sktime.

This covers both `transformer-pairwise` (tabular) and `transformer-pairwise-panel` (time series) scitypes.

## How to Add Items

1. Open an issue on the [sktime issue tracker](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues) describing the algorithm
2. Add the item below following the format template
3. Submit a PR with your addition

## Format Template

```markdown
- [ ] **Algorithm Name** - Brief description
  - Paper: [Title](link) or Reference: [Package](link)
  - Issue: #1234
```
